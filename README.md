Ash stands for the **A**nsible **SH**ell, it's a little command line using [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit), a python
library for writing interactive command lines.
The aim of this project was for me to have fun, and using extensively my terminal and Ansible, I wanted a tool like the
default ansible-console one, but with some features that prompt_toolkit allows.
